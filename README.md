## Background
I was looking for a good dataset to develop my first serious project, and I found this one. My interest in this dataset is to use my data abilities to know how the productivity and finance apps perform, more precisely which are the best. Then I looked for the price behavior, and at the end for the category distribution of the overall dataset.

## Findings 
#### Category distribution: 
We can see how tools, game and family categories are the most popular categories in the play store, to be precise they represent 39.5% of the apps.

#### Price distribution:
**FIRST:** I found that free apps (0.00 cost) are 7593 surprisingly, and they represent 92 % of the entire app dataset.
So I deleted 0.00 cost because it was too high, and looked for the priced apps.
We can see a higher peak around 0.99 and 5.00
