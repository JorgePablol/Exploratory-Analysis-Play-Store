## [Background](#Table-of-contents)
My interest in this dataset is to use my data abilities to know how the productivity and finance apps perform, more precisely which are the best. I'm also interested in the price and category distribution to take a glance the most offered and monetized apps.

## [Data:](#Table-of-contents)
### Gathering data:

## [Findings](#Table-of-contents) 
### [Category distribution:](#Table-of-contents) 
We can see how tools, game and family categories are the most popular categories in the play store, to be precise they represent 39.5% of the apps.

### [Price distribution:](#Table-of-contents) 
**FIRST:** I found that free apps (0.00 cost) are 7593 out of 8197 surprisingly, and they represent 92 % of the entire app dataset.
So I deleted 0.00 cost because it was too high, and looked for the priced apps.
We can see a higher peak around 0.99 and 5.00

### [Most installed apps](#Table-of-contents)
Surprisingly **communication apps represent 36% of the top 30 most installed apps**. The second most installed category is about **social networks that represents 16%**. As we saw in the category distribution the larger categories are **tools, game and family**, and **neither of them are majority here in the most installed apps**.

### [Most installed of finance](#Table-of-contents)
Here we can see **google pay** has a higher ground from the second place. **Pay pal** one of the firsts online transactions services is in the second place, the rest is dominated by **bank applications and investment applications**.

### [Most installed of productivity](#Table-of-contents)
This is clearly **dominated by Microsoft and google apps**, the top of them are focused on **cloud management**. The rest are actually known productivity apps about **calculators, alarm clocks, file explorers**.
